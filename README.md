# Bravo2048

A fork of Gabriele Cirulli's [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048)
which was, in turn, a clone clone of
[1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based
on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (yet another clone).

This adds a simple little AI player -- more like autopilot than artifical
intelligence. [Test drive it](http://ahl.github.io/Bravo2048/)
